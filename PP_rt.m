% This S-Function computes an RST controller based on the pole placement technique.
% The input vector u has two vector inputs for the coefficients of A and B polynomials 
% and a vector for the desired closed-loop polynomial P. The
% fixed parts of the controllers are specified in Hs and Hr vectors.
% The output of the block is the RST controller as column vectors. 
% The polynomial T is computed to have the same dynamics for regulation and tracking.
% Ts is the sampling period
